# Generalized Linear Models - DEs/UEM #

## Regression models: Applications in counting and proportions data

 > The final work developed for the course of Generalized Linear Models in the first semester of 2017 at [DEs/UEM](http://www.des.uem.br/) minister by professor [Rosangela Getirana Santana](http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?metodo=apresentar&id=K4781706A4)

## Description
This work presents the analyze of two datasets in which the response variables are, in their nature, discrete from a given count, and restricted to the interval (0, 1).

 * The first dataset is from [Long (1990)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2579146) and the response variable is the number of
publications of Ph.D. students in the last three years. The main goal of this analysis is to determine which factors affect the produtivity of the Ph.D students. 

* The second dataset refer to the proportion of valid votes that the former president Dilma receive in the second round of the 2010 election, considering the cities of Parana state. In this analysis the goal is to assess which were the main factors that influence the proportion of votes obtained by Dilma.
